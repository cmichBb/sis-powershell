# SIS-PowerShell

(Eventually) A PowerShell Module for interacting with SIS Integrations in Blackboard Learn (but for now a collection of PowerShell scipts to do so)

This is still very much an early work-in-progress. Please submit issues as you find them, and (obviously, I hope) feel free to make pull requests, forks etc.

Mentioned as part of my BbWorld 2015 presentation [The SIS Framework: It's Not a Big Truck, It's a Series of Tubes!](https://speakerdeck.com/ksbarnt/the-sis-framework-its-not-a-big-truck-its-a-series-of-tubes)
